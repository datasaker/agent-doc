# dsk-base-agent

`Base agent` collects various information generated by the server in real time.
For example, you can collect various information such as server performance indicators such as memory and CPU usage, network traffic, and container information.
This allows customers to monitor server status in real time, and based on this, optimize server performance and increase stability.
We tailor agent settings to your needs to deliver optimal results.
