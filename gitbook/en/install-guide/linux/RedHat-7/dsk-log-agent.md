# dsk-log-agent

A `Log agent` is an agent that collects, processes and transmits log data generated by systems or applications in near real time in various environments. It can be used to centrally manage and analyze log data generated by multiple servers through `Log agent`. As a result, users can quickly detect and respond to problems occurring in the system or applications. In addition, log data can be analyzed and used for various purposes such as security, performance, and business analysis. We tailor agent settings to your needs to deliver optimal results.

## Install Log agent

### Install the fluent-bit package

`Log agent` collects logs through fluent-bit, so fluent-bit version 2.1.0 or higher must be installed when installing the agent.

Install fluent-bit 2.1.0 or higher using the following command.
```shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fluent/fluent-bit/master/install.sh | sh
```
For details on installing the fluent-bit package, refer to the [official document](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/installation/linux/redhat-centos).

### 1. Install the package
```shell
sudo yum install dsk-log-agent
```
### 2. agent-config settings

Create agent-config file in `/etc/datasaker/dsk-log-agent/agent-config.yml` path.

For example, if you are collecting log files, you could write a configuration file like this:
```yaml
agent:
  logs:
    - collect:
        type: file
        file:
          paths:
            - '/var/log/sample/*.log'
```
> Caution: Set the log collection target path so that files other than log files are not set. Specify a file in the log collection path or exclude other files. Be sure to write the file extension format in log collection settings. (e.g. `.log`)


### 3. Run the package
```shell
systemctl enable dsk-log-agent --now
```
### 4. Check package execution status
```shell
systemctl status dsk-log-agent
```
## Remove Log agent

### 1. Abort the package
```shell
systemctl stop dsk-log-agent
```
### 2. Remove packages

Be sure to stop and remove the package before uninstalling it.
```shell
yum remove dsk-log-agent
```
## Set Log agent configuration

If you want to change log agent log collection settings, modify the configuration file in the `/etc/datasaker/dsk-log-agent/agent-config.yml` path.

Following is a description of each setting item in the log agent configuration file.
```yaml
agent:
  metadata:
    agent_name:
    cluster_id:
  logs:
    - service:
      tag: []
      keyword: []
      multiline:
        format:
        pattern: []
      masking:
        - pattern:
          replace:
      collect:
        type:
        category:
        address:
        file:
          paths: []
          exclude_paths: []
```
